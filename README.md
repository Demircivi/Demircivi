Hello, I'm **Doğu Emre DEMİRÇİVİ**. I develop **iOS and Backend Applications** and I like **reverse-engineering** applications. Also, **Swift**, **TypeScript/Node.js**, **Java**, and **C#** are my go-to languages.

I've been working for **Solid-ICT** for over 3 years as a **Senior iOS & Backend Developer**. Also, I'm an **iOS Developer** consultant of **Turkcell**.

I've been coding since I was **13 years old** and this depends on a hilarious story:

When I was a child I was randomly looking for program CDs in a CD shop and I had found a CD and its cover image(it had infinity(**∞**) symbol on it) seemed so pleasant then I bought it. *Yes, I bought the CD because I found its cover image so pleasant*. In the end, I've realized that it was the CD of **Visual Studio 6**. Thanks to my curiosity, I ended up learning **Visual Basic 6** as my first programming language.
